    <h2>Raph</h2>
    <p>Hey! My name is Raphael Eleazar, but you can call me Raph, thats what my friends and colleagues call me. Im from Philippines, currently living in Sydney. Me and my family are living down South for almost 5 years and its an amazing country, we really love it here!</p>
    <p>This coding is a lot of fun. My 9-year old daughter, Brianna Penn, is doing coding herself for more than a year and i cant keep up  with her as she goes more advance in her coding. So to ride with her in her coding journey, I got this awesome course and here she is guiding me and teaching me all through with it, and we're both enjoying it. Learning new stuffs plus bonding with your daughter, this will be really cool semester along the way!</p>
    <p>I've been working in an Engineering Company doing some Planning and Project Control works for most of my career and this course, Web Development is a breath of fresh air. Totally different stuff but equally exciting and wonderful. I sure hope to learn from all of you and enjoy this learning journey together. We'll all surely keep in touch and looking forward for that.</p>
